                  	The growing size and complexity of high-value scientific datasets are pushing the boundaries of traditional models of data access and discovery.  Many large datasets are only accessible through the systems on which they were created or require specialized software or computational resources. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Labs Workbench</b> is a scalable, web-based platform intended to support turn-key deployment of encapsulated data management and analysis tools to support exploratory analysis and development near research datasets. The Labs Workbench platform has also been effectively used to support workshop/training and hackathon environments.
